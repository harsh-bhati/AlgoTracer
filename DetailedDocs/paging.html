  <h1>What is Paging?</h1>
  <p>
    Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It allows the physical address space of a process to be non-contiguous, which helps to avoid external fragmentation and makes memory allocation more flexible.

  <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Page:</strong> A fixed-size block of logical memory. The process’s logical memory is divided into pages of equal size.</li>
    <li><strong>Frame:</strong> A fixed-size block of physical memory. Physical memory is divided into frames of the same size as pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Page Table:</strong> A data structure used to map logical pages to physical frames.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>How Paging Works</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>The process’s logical address space is divided into pages.</li>
    <li>Physical memory is divided into frames of the same size as pages.</li>
    <li>When a process is executed, its pages are loaded into available frames in physical memory.</li>
    <li>The page table keeps track of where each page is stored in physical memory.</li>
    <li>Logical addresses generated by the CPU are translated into physical addresses using the page table.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Advantages of Paging</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Eliminates external fragmentation by allowing non-contiguous allocation of physical memory.</li>
    <li>Allows processes to be larger than physical memory by loading pages as needed.</li>
    <li>Simplifies memory management and increases utilization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Disadvantages of Paging</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal fragmentation may occur if a process does not fully utilize the last page.</li>
    <li>Page table overhead can be large, especially for processes with large address spaces.</li>
    <li>Address translation requires additional memory access, which can slow down execution (mitigated by Translation Lookaside Buffers).</li>
